# Approve-A-Loan

This project uses the 1993 German Credit Dataset to predict whether a credit applicant will be a good or bad customer. The application uses a decision tree classifier to determine an outcome. The conceptual usage for this program would be for a small business, such as a used car dealership, to quickly process an application and determine if they should approve a loan for a customer.

This application is inspired and based on the following project: https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/node/215

The classifier used achieves a ~72% accuracy which is close to the expected accuracy determined above. The accuracy would increase dramatically with a large dataset, currently it only processes 1000 records.
